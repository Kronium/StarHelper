The former constructed computing systems for the burgeoning spacecraft industry and the latter maintained four systems worth of production yards (including the specialized component factories on their home system). The goal from day one was to build naval spacecraft, and the resulting company was tailor-made for military contract bidding in an era when mankind was marshalling its forces. As Messer consolidated power, Aegis was there to supply spacecraft to his legions. Craft like the Retaliator became synonymous with the governmentâ€™s iron hand.')
